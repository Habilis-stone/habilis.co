"Absolutely the best! <br />
I hired Joseph Locks of Habilis to repair my home after hurricane Harvey…  Hiring Joe was the best decision I could have possibly made.  From the moment I called Joe the day after the storm – he drove right over to survey the damage despite the fact that he was literally on his way out of town on vacation – all the way through the final touches, Joe went far above and beyond anything I would expect from even the best of contractors.  In addition to his overall commitment, he and his team were extremely professional, trustworthy and they were even punctual – I did not have to wait for one of them to arrive even a single time.  In the end, the work was finished quickly and was of extremely high quality – my house is beautiful again!!!  So if you have the opportunity to hire Joe, just do it.”  <br /><br />
