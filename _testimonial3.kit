We have the extreme privilege of working with Joe and his team at HABILIS Stone Works.  Joe is in complete control of his projects, attentive to the finer details, and most importantly, a great communicator.  From start to finish Joe stands in front of and behind his work.  We are truly grateful that Joe can serve our clients extraordinarily well.  Thank you,  Joe!
